FindMyFit
To extend the shopping experience beyond the Myntra platform, a browser extension can be added, enabling users to discover similar products while browsing the web. When watching a series or browsing content online, the extension identifies clothing and accessories and provides links to similar products available on Myntra. This seamless integration allows users to instantly shop for items they find appealing, capitalizing on spontaneous shopping impulses and driving additional traffic to Myntra's site.

MyntraSwiped
Myntra can enhance user engagement by implementing a swipe-based recommendation system where users can swipe left or right to indicate their preferences. Each user is allowed up to five right swipes per day, making their choices more deliberate. With every swipe, users earn points that accumulate towards discounts on future orders. This gamified approach not only makes shopping more interactive and enjoyable but also incentivizes regular use, leading to increased customer loyalty and higher conversion rates.
